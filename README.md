# UPNOD CARD0117 TN64
This repository contains all the knowledge I could gather about a vintage, 80-ies TelCo card marked CARD0117 model TN-135:

# Notable observations
## Upgrade
The card appears to have been modded at one point. It's factory marked as TN-104 (despite the actual PCB being marked TN64), but that has been crossed-out and marked TN-135 with a faint marker. The aboundance of blue mod-wires seems to support this.

# Why?

I find the idea of Full-Full-Stack Development (FE downto metal) appealing, so I've started making some lateral movements towards it. Also, computer archeology, what's not to like?
